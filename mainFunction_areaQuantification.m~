% Fix import filename issue. Need the filenames to come from the
% filenames themselves, not as user input
%% Inputs for user
%replace "Pictures" with where your folder containing the pictures is
location = '~/Documents/Work for Scott/Image_processing/Pictures/';

%name the excel file where the areas are stored
name_of_excel_file = 'test5';

%% Code stuff

%load_data_and_clean_filenames loads the data and removes '.jpg' from the
%end of the filename. I_struct contains the BW images and their names
I_struct = load_data_and_clean_filenames(location);

%run the code on the images. BW_out_array is the BW images, Area_array is a
%cell of the areas of each file. 
[BW_out_array,Area_array] = multiple_fR(I_struct,name_of_excel_file);

%if you want to see a BW picture, type imshow(BW_out_array.name_of_file) in
%the command window. If you want to see a list of specific areas, type
%Area_array.name_of_file in the command window
